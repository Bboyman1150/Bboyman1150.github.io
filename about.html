    <h3>Hello?</h3>
    <p>I started my web design career during high school in my Web Design 1 class spring semester 2017. This was my first experience with anything remotely coding related and I instantly grew to enjoy it and excelled in the class, becoming a person that my classmates would come to if they had a question or an issue with their wesbsite.</p>

    <h3>See below one of my websites I made my senior year of high school:</h3> <br><a href="https://thatone4pplenerd.000webhostapp.com/" class="text-light">Repair Website</a>
    <p>Up until this time, I had created html and css code either from scratch, or later using Adobe Dreamweaver (unfortunately).</p>
